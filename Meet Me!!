- 👋 Hi, I’m @spasmflow but my first name is Tosin
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Web development, data analysis and technical writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development with Alx-Africa and freeCodeCamp. I'm also taking on the side DataScience with Python classes with DataCamp.
- 💞️ I’m just starting out in the tech world and I've only been coding for less than six months .
- 📫 I'd love to meet more tech entusiasts, whether you're just starting out like me or have been in the field for years.
- 💻 Aspiring Data Scientist
